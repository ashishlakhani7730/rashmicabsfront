                                           15 KM FROM BHAVNAGAR, Maharaja Wakhatsinghji Gohil ruled the state of Bhavnagar from 1748 to 1816. He was a devout follower of Khodiyar Ma and often visited the shrine at Mandel. There he prayed to the goddess to bring her holy presence to Sihor- the capital of Bhavnagar state. Khodiyar Ma agreed and told him to lead the way, only on the condition that he doesn’t turn around and check if she is following. Wakhatsinghji walked on, until he reached a place right before Sihor. There he turned around to check for Khodiyar Ma, who said she would walk no further for he had looked. Mataji and her sisters decided to set base there. This place was Rajpara, which became the shrine of Khodiyar Ma.

The shipyards at Alang recycle approximately half of all ships salvaged around the world, It is considered the world's largest graveyard of ships,The yards are located on the Gulf of Khambat, 50 km (31 mi) southeast of Bhavnagar,

<p>Large supertankers, car ferries, container ships, and a dwindling number of ocean liners are beached during high tide, and as the tide recedes, hundreds of manual laborers move onto the beach to dismantle each ship, salvaging what they can and reducing the rest to scrap.
